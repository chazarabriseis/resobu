The remote social butterfly acts to stimulate the informal communication culture in organisation or at conferences. By doing the work behind the scenes to recreate those chance encounters that support formation of strong networks. Remote Social Butterfly connects people either on a random or data-driven basis. Remote Social Butterfly helps to replace those chance encounters before and after meetings, in the hallways and at the water cooler, by arranging short chats in the calendar between two or more people.'

It brings cohesive teams, improve performance, efficient solutions, happy clients and new innovations. Communication is the cornerstone to effective collaboration. Teams and groups that can communicate openly, purposefully and effectively will create the environment in which collaboration can thrive. The digital era, working from home and global pandemics are transforming and disrupting the way communication in organisations and at conference functions. Maintaining effective integrated communication is key to fostering and maintaining a collaborative environment.'

            text: 'The right conditions for innovation to occur are varied, but one place it definitely wonâ€™t occur is where the right people are not working together. The overwhelming majority of successful innovation stories come from teams. Teams that work not just within departments but across departments to understand the full picture from marketing to finance, from research to production, from legal to post sales supports. The ability to engage in a collaborative environment across the business improves the likelihood that successful innovation and performance will follow. Conversely, studies have shown, incidence of communication drops sharply within an organisation, even with increased distance between departments and across multiple building levels. Imagine how it suffers in the time of working from home. Intoducing Remote Social Butterfly chats will reintroduce those chance and random encounters.'
